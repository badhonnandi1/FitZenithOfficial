##Introduction
The Fitness School Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline and centralize the operations of a fitness coaching institution. This system supports structured coordination between coaches and trainees, enabling personalized workout planning, progress tracking, resource sharing, and communication  all within a single, cohesive environment.
Whether used by a personal trainer, a fitness academy, or a health-focused community, the system provides an efficient way to manage multiple training programs, monitor trainee performance, and maintain accountability throughout the fitness journey.

##Purpose and Target Users
The primary goal of the platform is to enhance the effectiveness of fitness training by offering a centralized, user-friendly solution for:
Admins who oversee program operations and manage system users
Instructors who guide trainees, assign personalized workout routines, and upload fitness resources
Trainees who follow customized fitness programs, track their body transformation, and access meal/workout plans


While traditional tools like WhatsApp groups, spreadsheets, or manual tracking are still used, they often result in fragmented communication and inconsistent tracking. This Fitness School Management System addresses those issues by integrating all core functionalities  improving structure, engagement, and long-term progress for both trainers and trainees.
