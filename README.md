## 🎯 Purpose and Target Users

The main goal of FitZenith is to **enhance the effectiveness of fitness training** by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform that solves issues related to fragmented communication and inconsistent tracking via traditional tools (like WhatsApp and spreadsheets).

### 👥 Target Users:

- **Admins**: Manage users, programs, and create/delete events.
- **Instructors**: Guide trainees, assign workouts, and upload resources.
- **Trainees (Normal Users)**: Follow customized fitness plans, track metrics (BMI, BMR), and register for fitness events.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 Profile Management
- View and update personal details (name, phone number, fitness stats).

### 🏃 Event Management

## 🏗️ Software Architecture

FitZenith follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern for better maintainability and separation of concerns:

- **Model**: Manages database structure and business logic using SQLAlchemy.
  - Core Models: `User`, `Marathon`, `MarathonRegistration`
- **View**: HTML templates powered by **Jinja2** to render the user interface.
- **Controller**: Flask routes and Blueprints process requests, interact with models, and serve views.
